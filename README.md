# Week 2 - Activity 01
Demonstrate basic NumPy operation

## Activity Summary
- Created a NumPy array using arange of the first 10 positive integers.
- Inspected the array attributes shape and dtype and printed it
- Performed Vectorized operations in NumPy (element-wise multiplication or multiplying array elements by 2) and displayed the result.

# Week 2 - Activity 02
NumPy Student Scores Analysis - This activity focuses on analyzing and manipulating a 2D NumPy array of student scores.

## Activity Summary
- Store scores of 5 students across 3 subjects in a 2D array.
- Using the enumarate object have displayed the students ID and subject scores (Row-wise)
- Using mean in Numpy each student's scores and their average has been calculated (Row-wise)
- Using mean in Numpy calculated and displayed the average for each subject (column-wise)
- Using the sum function in Numpy calculated the total score for each student (Row-wise and column-wise operations)
    The values are then passed into the function argmax to identify the student with the highest total score.
- Identify the location of the third subject in the array and add bonus marks to the specific subject and update the array.
    Vectorized array updates have been used to update the subject in column index 2
